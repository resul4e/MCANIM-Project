 * \mainpage Skeletal Animation MCANIM 2020 Group 5
 *
 * \section Intro
 *
 * This is the documentation generated for our skeletal animation project. We were tasked
 * to create an application that was capable of playing back both keyframed animations as well
 * as motion capture animations. As a bonus we opted to implement skinning. We were able to implement
 * both Dual Quaternion \htmlonly Skinning \endhtmlonly (DualQuaternionSkinning) as well as Linear
 * Blend \htmlonly Skinning \endhtmlonly (LinearBlendSkinning).
 *
 * The project is written fully in C++ using C++17. Rendering is achieved using a custom OpenGL renderer.
 * Asset loading is handled by Assimp where it is converted into our own data structures. For in-editor tweaks
 * and UI we are using ImGui. You can see an example of the finished project in the Gif below.
